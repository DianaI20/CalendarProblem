# CalendarProblem

The input will be stored in the input.txt file, in src folder. The input format will be as it follows: 
  - first line: the meeting time in minutes
  - second line: the range of the first booked calendar 
  - third line: the time intervals that are booked 
  - fourth line: range of the second calendar
  - fifth line: the time intervals that are booked for the second calendar
 
The time intervals must be separated with a space and they must be written in this format e.g: [12:00, 13:00]
